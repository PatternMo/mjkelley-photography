                    <p>I believe imagery is narrative.</p>

                    <p>I specialize in crafting compelling headshots, automotive imagery, and landscapes that communicate ideas.</p>

                    <p>My passion lies in bringing visions to life.</p>

                    <p>Photography is more than a profession for me; it's a way of creating tangible beauty, representing narratives, and celebrating artistry in everyday moments.</p>

                    <p>My career has been a journey through creativity and connection. Beginning at age nine, using black-and-white film and a point-and-shoot Kodak camera to connect with rolling fog on sea cliffs and giant redwoods, and now filming Porsche's unveiling events, creating images has always been about capturing feelings, stories, and moments that invite viewers to see beyond the surface—to an idea, a vision.</p>

                    <p>I've cultivated a practice centered on the art of collaboration and the joy of helping others succeed.</p>

                    <p>Along the way, I've published short fiction, worked with renowned brands like Bring A Trailer and Porsche, and developed a reputation for strategic thinking and unwavering curiosity.</p>

                    <p>What sets me apart is my ability to manage complex relationships with warmth and authenticity. My background as a published writer and editor informs my photographic work, giving me an eye for detail and a knack for storytelling that translates across mediums.</p>

                    <p>Outside the studio, you can find me scaling and photographing peaks in the Sierra Nevada, exploring California's trails, taking in nature's epic quiet places, or indulging my obsession with music.</p>

                    <p>Looking ahead, I'm focused on scaling my photography business to reach more clients and transform their visions into impactful imagery.</p>

                    <p>Whether you need storytelling that resonates, artistry that captivates, or collaboration that feels effortless, let's connect—together, we can create something remarkable.</p>
